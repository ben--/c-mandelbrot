# c-mandelbrot

Drawing the Mandelbrot set in C.

## TODO

7. Paint pixels black iff they're inside the unit circle (after translating pixels to real (x,y) coordinates)
7. Paint pixels black iff they're inside the M-set (after translating pixels to complex coordinates and iterating till some limit)
7. Paint pixels in color by their "escape velocity"
7. Zoom in (after taking optional command-line parameters)
7. Use higher-precision math (after zooming in far enough that it matters).
7. If iterating over every pixel is slow, try tracing the boundary.

# c-mandelbrot

Drawing the Mandelbrot set in C.

## TODO

7. Use C's complex math functions.
7. Draw it bigger.
7. Preserve aspect ratio, even when canvas width and height differ!
7. Paint pixels in color by their "escape velocity".
7. Try using an ApprovalTest library to check the generated image.
7. Try another graphics library
   ([Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/FAQ/#minimal_C_program)?).
7. Zoom in (after taking optional command-line parameters)
7. Use higher-precision math (after zooming in far enough that it matters).
7. If iterating over every pixel is slow, try tracing the boundary.
